# Things To Consider

Before posting check out our [New Vaper's Guide](https://github.com/Vaporents/NewVaporsGuide) and the [Vape Consensus](https://github.com/Vaporents/VapeConsensus). They cover a lot of topics like what to do with abv, how vaporizers work, and what vapes are generally recommended by this sub.

Please read this for the suggested structure for purchase help and use the search bar before posting. Your question may have been already answered.

### Vaporizer Decision Template

Too often we get users writing paragraphs or even giving little information towards what they are looking for in a vaporizer. This is a template intended to help new users understand a few priorities they may want to consider for their vape purchase. It is also meant to help the existing vaporents quickly understand your needs to minimalize questions and wasted time.

> **Price Range:** How much are you wanting to pay? No one can give a suggestion without knowing your limit. If you have unlimited funds make it clear.

> **# of Participants:** How many people on average do you think you'll want to use this vape with. Would you prefer toking solo, wanting to share, or even bring it to a party?

> **Toking Routine:** How much/often do you smoke/vape currently? Try and list how much herb/bowls a day/week or even throughout the day.

> **Extraction Speed:** Did you want to vape through your herb quickly or have a lengthy session?

> **Environment/Form:** Where are you wanting to use this vaporizer, something small or large? Did you need something portable, portable and stealthy, or something for your home?

> **Vape Experience:** Is this your first vape, have you used or owned any vapes in the past? If you've got opinions or have used other vaporizers help us narrow down the options with a bit of your past experience.

> **Personal Requests:** Is there something specific you want in a vaporizer? Some want the best flavor, others prefer replaceable batteries or butane, some like a lot of airflow. Please mention anything

> **Location:** You don't have to tell us exactly where you live but knowing the country from the beginning will make the suggestions and site recommendations a lot better as we'd know what's available to you.
