### Vaporizer Decision Template

Too often we get users writing paragraphs or even giving little information towards what they are looking for in a vaporizer. This is a template intended to help new users understand a few priorities they may want to consider for their vape purchase. It is also meant to help the existing vaporents quickly understand your needs to minimalize questions and wasted time.

> **Price Range:** How much are you wanting to pay? No one can give a suggestion without knowing your limit. If you have unlimited funds make it clear.

> **# of Participants:** How many people on average do you think you'll want to use this vape with. Would you prefer toking solo, wanting to share, or even bring it to a party?

> **Toking Routine:** How much/often do you smoke/vape currently? Try and list how much herb/bowls a day/week or even throughout the day.

> **Extraction Speed:** Did you want to vape through your herb quickly or have a lengthy session?

> **Environment/Form:** Where are you wanting to use this vaporizer, something small or large? Did you need something portable, portable and stealthy, or something for your home?

> **Vape Experience:** Is this your first vape, have you used or owned any vapes in the past? If you've got opinions or have used other vaporizers help us narrow down the options with a bit of your past experience.

> **Personal Requests:** Is there something specific you want in a vaporizer? Some want the best flavor, others prefer replaceable batteries or butane, some like a lot of airflow. Please mention anything

> **Location:** You don't have to tell us exactly where you live but knowing the country from the beginning will make the suggestions and site recommendations a lot better as we'd know what's available to you.
